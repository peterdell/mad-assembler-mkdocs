## Formatting and Spelling Rules
Formatting and spelling rules are essential for a consistent document and good reading experience.
- Command line options and their arguments are lower case as in the output on the commannt line, see [Usage](#/docs/en/docs/usage.md).
- Messages are bold and in single quotes **'Example message'**.
- Use **WDC 65816** for references to the Western Design Center 65816 CPU. 
- Use 'added directive' instead of 'added new directive', because adding implies that it is new already
- Use upper case for directives and commands, use lower case for labels and operands
